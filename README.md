# Source for the Necrogastronomicon site.

Built with [Hugo Static Site Generator](https://www.gohugo.io)

There's scaffolding for running Hugo inside a Docker container, just to keep dependencies and packages, and so on, isolated from the host system.

The scaffolding is pretty light. You'll have to build the image from the Dockerfile.

// TODO: add directions for that. Be nice.

`run.sh` starts a shell in the container, where any hugo command can be executed.

// TODO: check if `hugo server -D` works with ports.
